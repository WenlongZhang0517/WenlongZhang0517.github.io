<!-- A simple inline announcement with Markdown emoji! :sparkles: :smile: -->
Two papers were accepted by **ICLR2025**. Our [WeatherGFM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05420) is the first generalist weather foundation model that can flexibly handle more than 10 weather understanding tasks. It outperforms ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) forecast results.
<!-- By analyzing the relationships between image degradations, [GRIDS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12273) propose a grouped learning method to deal with multiple-degradation restoration. [X-Restormer](https://github.com/Andrew0613/X-Restormer) is a new general image restoration backbone network, which possesses good task generality and achieves competitive performance across a variety of restoration tasks. -->
