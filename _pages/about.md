I am a Young Researcher with [OpenScienceLab](https://science.openxlab.org.cn/) at Shanghai AI Lab, working with Prof. [Wanli Ouyang](https://wlouyang.github.io/) and Prof. [Lei Bai](http://leibai.site/). Before that, I got the PhD degree from Hong Kong Polytechnic University, working with Prof. [Xiao-Ming Wu](http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csxmwu/). I also interned at [XPixel group](http://xpixel.group/) in Shanghai AI Lab and SIAT-CAS, working with Prof. [Chao Dong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=OSDCB0UAAAAJ) and Prof. [Yu Qiao](http://mmlab.siat.ac.cn/team). In 2018, I got the Master degree from the Beijing Institute of Technology, supervised by Prof. [Weidong Hu](https://ice.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsfc/895feca632d747dc81769fbaf7be5ef5.htm).

I am passionate about exploring advanced AGI models to address challenges across large-scale scientific scenario. Recently, my primary areas of focus include:
- `Large foundation model`: Developing general foundational models for the unified representation and processing of data and tasks in earth science.
- `Multimodel learning`: Building multimodal understanding data and models for the phenomena and knowledge understanding of earth science .
- `LLM-based multi-agent`: Creating efficient LLM-based multi-agent systems for earth phenomena and knowledge discovery.
- `Generative models`: Aiming to combine multi-source data and physical law for more powerful and efficient scientific data synthesis.

<!-- * **AI for Earth Science**: Larger earth foundation model, Multi-modal weather generation and understanding<br> 
* **Computer Vision**: Multi-modal image generation, Image restoration and super-resolution -->

If you are interested in the above research topics and would like to join us with **[research intern](xx)** or **[Joint Training Ph.D. Project](https://www.shlab.org.cn/enrollment)** at Shanghai AI Lab, feel free to drop me an [email](zhangwenlong@pjlab.org.cn) zhangwenlong@pjlab.org.cn. Students with good foundations in AI background or earth science are appreciated.
