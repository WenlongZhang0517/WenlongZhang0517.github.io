I am a Postdoc Researcher (Incoming) at Shanghai AI Lab, working with Prof. [Wanli Ouyang](https://wlouyang.github.io/) and [Lei Bai](http://leibai.site/). I am a PhD student at Hong Kong Polytechnic University, working with Prof. [Xiao-Ming Wu](http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csxmwu/). Before that, I was a Research Intern at [XPixel group](http://xpixel.group/) with Prof. [Chao Dong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=OSDCB0UAAAAJ) and Prof. [Yu Qiao](http://mmlab.siat.ac.cn/team) in Shanghai AI Lab and SIAT-CAS. In 2018, I got the Master degree from the Beijing Institute of Technology, supervised by Prof. [Weidong Hu](https://ice.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsfc/895feca632d747dc81769fbaf7be5ef5.htm).

I am passionate about exploring advanced AI models to address challenges across large-scale (PB Level) Earth systems understanding and prediction. Recently, my primary areas of focus include:

* **Earth Science**: Multi-source fusion precipitation prediction, Information generation, Downscaling (super-resolution)<br> 
* **Computer Vision**: Multi-modality learning, Generative Model, Image super-resolution, etc.

If you are interested in the above research topics and would like to join us with research intern or [Joint Training Ph.D. Project](https://www.shlab.org.cn/enrollment) at Shanghai AI Lab, feel free to drop me an [email](zhangwenlong@pjlab.org.cn) zhangwenlong@pjlab.org.cn. Students with good foundations in AI background or Earth system forecasting are appreciated.
